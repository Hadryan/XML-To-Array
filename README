This is a very simple class to demonstrate basic XML parsing in
PHP. It takes a string of XML data and converts it to an
associative array (similar to json_decode($json_string, true)).
There is much more functionality that could be added, but since
I’m mostly working with JSON these days, I don’t know if or
when I’ll find the time or the necessity.

Usage is very simple:

<?php
  include 'xmlToArray.php';
  $xml_data = file_get_contents('your_data.xml');
  $xml_parser = new xmlToArray($xml_data);
  print_r($xml_parser->array);
?>

I've included a sample XML file ("people.xml") which you can
use for testing.
